5. Opinion I
Describe a technology trend which you think had the most impact on the developer community
within the last 2-3 years. How has that impacted you? Are you a proponent or an opponent of this
trend? Please don't write more than 1500 characters. The less the merrier.

*** ANSWER ***
Web development has moved from thin client to heavy client, reversing the previous trend which was 
heavily based on Java components/frameworks like JSF. AngularJS and other similar frameworks have taken a leading role
in web app clients development and I've learned to appreciate their use: faster development, simpler and faster testing,
no compilation. I'm a big fan of this simplified approach which helps consistently the separation of concerns and
system *abilities* (testability, maintainability, scalability, etc...) when used in conjuction to REST and HATEOAS.

6. Opinion II
Is Java ready for the 21st century? In your opinion, what are the main problems with Java and
whether other languages have solved them? Please don't write more than 1500 characters. The
less the merrier.

*** ANSWER ***
I don't believe Java has any big disadvantage. Other, more recent, languages might have interesting features Java lacks,
but I don't think those are game-changing features/constructs. JavaScript is getting more attention due to Node.js and the simplicity
of the language, no strong data typing and such, but I'm not sure I would adopt JavaScript on the server side for a long term 
business project.
