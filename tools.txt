You have done a git pull, which resulted in some conflicts that you resolved. Git is now showing
that your have 300 modified files which you need to commit, although you have not touched any of
them. What happened? If you have not used git, describe why you haven't and whether you like
your current VCS.

*** ANSWER ***
The conflicts prevented the automatic merge commit to be executed: the modified files are the files edited by the other members
of the team after the merge with my local files. I can commit the merge, but a full build is recommended to ensure my merge conflict
resolution didn't break any of the other changes I just merged.

Describe why you hate Maven. Have you used any alternatives? If so, how are they better?

*** ANSWER ***
I don't hate Maven, I use it every day and I appreciate most of it. Sometimes some plugins are not really stable and the error messages
are not always clear, but that has became an exception rather than a standard.
In the past I was quite used to Ant, but I moved to Maven quite early (since version 1.0.2) as a lot less verbose than Ant.
I've occasionally used Groovy, but I find it slow and I didn't invest enough time to get proficient at its usage.
